                Hello, my name is Matt and I am an aspiring software developer. I am currently enrolled in Case Western Reserve University Coding Boot Camp program for full stack web development. I am an ambitious, driven and experienced IT support technician, looking to utilize my programming and analysis expertise to obtain a software engineering position within a growth-oriented, progressive company. I presently work as an IT specialist at Hallrich where I maintain, troubleshoot and repair in-store POS systems and peripherals for 135 franchise owned Pizza Hut locations in Ohio.</p>
